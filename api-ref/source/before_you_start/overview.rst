Overview

Welcome to *Cloud Backup and Recovery API Reference*. Cloud Backup and Recovery (CBR) allows you to back up Elastic Cloud Servers (ECSs) and Elastic Volume Service (EVS) disks with ease. If there is a virus attack, accidental deletion, or software or hardware fault, data can be restored to any point in the past when the data was backed up. With CBR, you can back up and restore data on the cloud.

You can use APIs provided in this document to perform operations on CBR, such as creating and deleting a vault, and creating a policy. For details about all supported operations, see :ref:`API Overview <cbr_04_0007>`.

Before calling CBR APIs, ensure that you have fully understood relevant concepts. For details, see section "Service Overview" in the *Cloud Backup and Recovery User Guide*.
