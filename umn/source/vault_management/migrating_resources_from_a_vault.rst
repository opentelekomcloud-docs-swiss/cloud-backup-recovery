Migrating Resources from a Vault
================================

Migrating a resource means that you dissociate a resource from a vault and then associate it to another vault. All backups of the resource will be migrated to the destination vault.

Notes and Constraints
---------------------

-  Resources can be migrated only when the source and destination vaults are in the **Available** or **Locked** state.
-  Resources can be migrated only when no task is being executed in the source and destination vaults.
-  The remaining capacity of the destination vault must be greater than the size of resource backups to be migrated.
-  Cross-account resource migration is currently not supported.
-  The source and destination vaults must be in the same region.
-  The source and destination vaults for resource migration must be of the same types. For example, resources in a server backup vault can be migrated to another server backup vault, but cannot be migrated to another disk backup vault.
